## Introduction

PXGen is an Explainable AI method designed to work with generative models. It provides example-based explanations for users, offering benefits such as faster processing and diverse perspectives on explanations.

In this code , we demonstrate how PXGen can be applied to a Variational AutoEcoder (VAE) model to show its explanation capability . 

## Features

- Provides intuitive explanations .
- Does not require information from training phase .
- Offers diverse perspectives on expalnaions.
